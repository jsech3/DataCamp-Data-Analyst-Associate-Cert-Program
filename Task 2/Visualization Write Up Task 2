Create a visualization that shows the number of claims in each location. Use the
visualization to:

a. State which category of the variable location has the most observations
b. Explain whether the observations are balanced across categories of the
variable location

Visualization in Folder, labeled as 'Task 2 Vis'

A. The category of the variable location with the highest amount of claims was 'RECIFE'.

B. The observations are not balanced across categories of the variable location as 'RECIFE' appears to have nearly three times as many as 'NATAL'. 
To optimize business and improve efficiency, this organization should try to look into why RECIFE has so many claims.
