  As we can see in the t4_box1 and t4_img, there is no significant difference between the means of these locations. 
Because the p-value is 0.76, this is much higher than anything that would indicate a relationship between the two variables 
(would be closer to 0 if so), so we must accept the null hypothesis. 
The means of the four locations all fall within a range of four numbers, all being between 184 and 187 days of average time to close. 
From this analysis of the variables, we deduce that there is no relationship between time to close and location, 
and any sort of supposed correlation is likely by chance.
