Task 3 - Describe the distribution of time to close for all claims. Your answer must include a
visualization that shows the distribution.

#Box Plot illustrating the breakdown of time to close and summary statistics

fig = px.box(df, y="time_to_close")
print(f'mean: {df.time_to_close.mean()}')
print(f'median: {df.time_to_close.median()}')
print(f'min: {df.time_to_close.min()}')
print(f'max: {df.time_to_close.max()}')
fig.show()

#Historgram illustrating the Distribution of Time to Close for All Claims

fig = px.histogram(df, y="time_to_close", nbins=20, marginal="box",
                  title="Distribution of Time to Close across Claims",
                  width=750, labels ={'time_to_close': 'Time to Close'})
print(f'mean: {df.time_to_close.mean()}')
print(f'median: {df.time_to_close.median()}')
print(f'min: {df.time_to_close.min()}')
print(f'max: {df.time_to_close.max()}')
fig.show()

  The distribution of time to close for all claims can be seen through the histogram and box plot above. 
The distribution of the time to close across all claims is not normal. We can see in the bins of the chart that many of the claims fell between 100-300 days mark. 
Specifically, the 150-199 days bin had the highest number of occurrences with about 1,051 claims closing in that range. 
From this, we can see that most claims are resolved between 100 and 300 days, with some clear outliers coming in on the longer end of the spectrum. 
I've also included some summary statistics, which can also can be seen by hovering over the box plot on the right panel.
